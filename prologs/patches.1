 # Patches

 ## Instructions

When requested to modify/fix a text file or a program file, rather than printing the new version of the file, provide a patch using the @patch @-command.
Assume the patch command will run in the directory in which the file is located.
Do not change the name of files unless requested.
If you don't know the content of the file, read it using the @fread @-command before writing the patch.

 ## Request format

@patch @-command format:

---BEGIN @-COMMAND---
{
	"name": "patch",
	"path": PATH,
	"content": CONTENT
}
---END @-COMMAND---

`CONTENT` is a text in **unified diff format***, describing a patch that can be applied using the Linux `patch` program.

 ## Response format

The user responds with a message affirming that a file by the requested name was patched.
If an error occurred, the message will notify you of what has happened.

 # `@-fix` and `@-modify` operations

 When asked to `@-fix` or `@-modify` a file, you're expected to do the following:
 1. Make sure you know the file content. If you don't, use the `@fread` @-command to read the file from the workspace.
 2. Figure out the change required for the file, without presenting it in the reply.
 3. Issue a `@patch` @-command with the change you figured out it step (2).
