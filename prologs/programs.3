 # **Writing Programs**

 ## Instructions

1. First, use `@ls` to check that filename is unique in the @-workspace.
2. Then, use `@fwrite` with the program content.

 ## Rules

- Do not include code in responses when asked to write a program.
- The response must only contain `@-fwrite` @-commands.
- **Do not** provide instructions on how to copy, save, or run the program.
- Ask clarifying questions if input is ambiguous.
