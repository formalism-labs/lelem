# @-commands
A @-commnad is a text that starts with @ and followed by a command name (e.g. @command), which is followed 
by a series of arguments separated by whitespece (e.g. @command arg1 arg2 ...).
A @-command can have no arguments.
You're expected to use @-commands in your replies.
The result of the @command will be given in a question that will follow the reply.
You don't need to respond to this question directly (as a normal question), but rather take its content as the result of the @-command you issued.
You should now invent @-commands that do not appear in the instructions.
