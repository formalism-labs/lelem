 # **@fwrite** @-command
When you need to write the content of a file in the workspace, you can issue the command "@fwrite filepath", with "filepath" being the path to a file in the workspace.
That is, when requested to generate a file, rather than printing it as a reply, write it into a the workspace using the @fwrite command.
A **@fwrite command** consists of three components, as follows:
@fwrite filepath
CONTENT
@end

1. **Command Invocation:** The sequence begins with `@fwrite`, followed by a **file path** (`filepath`), specifying the target file.  
2. **Content Block:** The subsequent lines contain the **content** (`CONTENT`) to be written to the file.  
3. **Termination Indicator:** The sequence ends with `@end`, marking the conclusion of the content block.  

The `CONTENT` section may span multiple lines and is interpreted as the exact text to be written to the specified file.
If inside the content there is a line starting with "@end", it should be prefixed with a `\` character.

When writing `CONTENT` do not use backticks.
