 # **@fwrite** @-command

 ## Request format

@write @-command format:

---BEGIN @-COMMAND---
{
	"name": "fwrite",
	"path": PATH,
	"content": CONTENT
}
---END @-COMMAND---

The `path` key is the path of the file in the workspace (a string).
The `content` key is the content of the file.

 ## Response format

The user responds with a message affirming that a file by the requested name was written.
If an error occurred, the message will notify you of what has happened.

 ## Instructions

When you need to write the content of a file in the workspace, use the `@fwrite` @-command.
That is, when requested to generate a file, rather than printing it as a reply, write it into a the workspace using the `@fwrite` @-command.

 ### Figuring out a name for the file

If the user has explicitly asked to use a specific file name, you should do that.
When the file name is not given, figure out a reasonable name.
In this case, you should verify that the name does not already exist in the workspace using the `@ls` @-command.
If it does, figure out a new name and repeat the process. Don't try to get too smart with this. Just use serial numbers (001, 002, 003, etc.).
