 # @-commands

 ## Format

A @-commnad is a JSON structure of the form:  

---BEGIN @-COMMAND---
{
	"name": COMMAND-NAME
	ARGUMENTS
}
---END @-COMMAND---

COMMAND-NAME: a string that defined the command name.
ARGUMENTS: key/value pairs that are the command argments. Each @-command has its own arguments.
ARGUMENTS can be empty.

 ## Instructions

When you need to read or write information from/to the @-workspace, use (issue, that is, write into response) a @-command.
# Use (i.e. issue) @-commands in your replies to read or write information from/to the @-workspace.
The result of the @-command will be given by the user in a question that will follow the reply.
*Do not respond to this question directly (as a normal question), but rather treat the question content as the result of the @-command you issued.*
After issuing a @-command, process the response logically. Do not repeat the same command unless the user's query or new information explicitly requires it.

 ## Rules

- *Do not invent @-commands that do not appear in the instructions.*
- *Do not issue more than one @-command in a single reply.*
